Question: The 66-year-old Brisbane Broncos boss will speak to RFL officials before deciding whether to accept a position.\nSteve McNamara's contract as England coach expired after the 2-1 series win over New Zealand last autumn.\nBennett told the Brisbane Courier-Mail: \"We haven't finalised the role but I've been offered some opportunities. I have to find out how they see me involved.\"\nBennett is one of the game's most experienced coaches and was in charge of Brisbane for 20 years from their formation in 1988. He won six Grand Finals before moving to St George-Illawarra Dragons, where he won another NRL title in 2010.\nIn addition, he has had three spells with the Queensland State of Origin team and two spells in charge of the national team.\nA passionate supporter of international rugby league, he was part of the New Zealand coaching team that won the World Cup in 2008, but was overlooked in favour of Mal Meninga when he applied for the Australia job again in December 2015.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"Everything is on the table,\" said Bennett. \"I wanted to coach Australia, but it's not available now. I wanted to make a contribution to international rugby league.\n\"About five years ago, the RFL first arrived at my doorstep. It is always about finding the right timing.\"\nThe RFL has refused to comment on any discussions with Bennett. It is carrying out a review of the England set-up, which will be concluded in February.\nBennett is due in England next month for Brisbane's World Club Series game at Wigan on 20 February.\nEngland will play Australia, New Zealand and Scotland in the Four Nations tournament in November.\nBBC Sport's Simon Stone\nWayne Bennett is one of the most respected coaches in rugby league and his appointment - even on a part-time basis - would be a huge coup for the RFL. But if, as anticipated, Bennett combined the job with his present role with Brisbane Broncos, it would raise an issue over how well he knew the Super League players he would be working with.\nMany of England's top players, including Canterbury's James Graham and Sam Burgess, who recently returned to the sport after an ill-fated spell in rugby union, are based in Australia. But the majority remain in England and while Bennett will be able to watch virtually every Super League game on TV, he will be relying largely on the opinions of others when it comes to their personalities.
Answer: Former Australia coach Wayne Bennett has been offered a role with England by the Rugby Football League.

Question: 11 April 2016 Last updated at 18:11 BST\nAlex Zosel told the BBC that his device was safer than a traditional helicopter because its systems had more redundancy built-in.\nThe Volocopter can continue to fly if some of its batteries or rotors fail, and can land itself when battery power is low.\nHowever, the multicopter can currently fly for only 25 minutes and is expected to cost \u00c2\u00a3200,000 when it goes on sale.
Answer: An 18-rotor multicopter has been taken on its first manned flight in Germany.

Question: If they needed a little calm, the gardens they have created - many on themes of peace and tranquillity - could have provided it.\nJekka McVicar, who designed A Modern Apothecary for St John's Hospice, says the garden is about health and wellbeing.\nEverything in it - from rosemary and fennel to the sound of running water - can be good for body and mind, she says.\nShe spoke to doctors, carers and artists before creating the garden, which is about the \"power of plants\".\nAlso focusing on health and healing is Paul Martin, creator of The Garden of Mindful Living for Vestra Wealth.\nIt is intended as a calm space for mindfulness and wellness in a busy city life, with soft colours that are \"not jarring on the eyes\".\nThere is plenty of green - a colour Mr Martin says has proven calming effects on children with ADHD.\nMatthew Wilson designed God's Own Country - A Garden for Yorkshire based on inspiration from York Minster's East Window, which is the largest single expanse of medieval stained glass in Britain.\n\"Trying to get something of that scale and presence and sheer power in a Chelsea garden is an interesting challenge,\" he says.\nHe says he set about \"deconstructing\" all elements on the window's design and \"putting them back together in a different order\" in the garden, which is sponsored by Welcome to Yorkshire.\nAs well as a \"colourful tapestry\" of planting based on the window's colours, there is an arch laid on its side containing benches which point towards a \"very calm, small cloister garden\".\nNick Bailey, designer of The Winton Capital Beauty of Mathematics Garden, says the concept is about \"subtly highlighting the mathematics that underpins everything\".\n\"No matter how wild something looks it's actually driven by algorithms and equations,\" he says.\nA copper band runs through the garden, and on it are equations for processes including photosynthesis and cellular expansion.\nThe band represents a stem, and as it winds through the garden - changing function from a bench to a banister to a planter - the planting thickens to reflect growth.\nDiarmuid Gavin, who designed the Harrods British Eccentrics garden, says he mixed traditional themes with \"a little bit of madness\".\nAs well as \"fireworks\" of brightly coloured plants among more traditional planting, every 15 minutes the trees and one of the borders rotate and some bob up and down.\n\"I like to have a bit of fun and try something new,\" he explains.\nGarden designers and their teams - many in smart suits not typically worn for gardening - were busy watering, sweeping and making other last-minute adjustments on Monday morning before the arrival of the judges.\nSome teams were on their hands and knees for these final preparations in the London sunshine.\nA field of 300,000 hand-crocheted poppies, which covers the space between the showground and the Royal Hospital Chelsea, was designed by Phillip Johnson, who won Best Show Garden in 2013.\nThey are a tribute to those who served in all wars, and were made by \"people from a range of cultures, and communities and ages, from two to 102 years old\", the Royal Horticultural Society said.\nAlso at the show is a 10ft (3m) high floral installation created by Veevers Carter for New Covent Garden Flower Market in honour of the Queen's 90th birthday.\nMade up of 10,000 flowers, 112 buckets and 300m of ribbon, it forms a portrait of the monarch.\nThe Queen and other members of the Royal Family, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, visited the show in the afternoon.\nMany of the exhibits mark the Queen's 90th birthday, including a 21ft floral arch of at least 10,000 blooms and an exhibition of royal photographs at Chelsea dating back to 1949.
Answer: Garden designers and their teams stood proudly - albeit a little nervously - as the judges began their rounds at the Chelsea Flower Show.

Question: Phyllida Lloyd will direct revivals of Julius Caesar and Henry IV and a new production of The Tempest, which are all set in a women's prison.\nHarriet Walter will play Brutus in Julius Caesar, King Henry in Henry IV, and Prospero in The Tempest.\nThe new in-the-round venue will be open for 13 weeks from 23 September.\nJulius Caesar and Henry IV were both staged by the company at the Donmar's Covent Garden base in 2012 and 2014 respectively.\nThe theatre hopes to make 25% of all tickets will be free to 25s and under with a new scheme called Young and Free, funded mainly through sponsorship and philanthropy.\nArtistic Director Josie Rourke said: \"I remember very clearly the furore created by the idea of an all-female Shakespeare, when Phyllida Lloyd first staged Julius Caesar with Harriet Walter in 2012.\n\"Phyllida Lloyd's work with this diverse, all-female company has been genuinely ground-breaking and in the intervening four years, theatre has got into the fast lane of debate and change.\n\"It's time, with these Young and Free tickets, to join together our question about who gets to play these roles with a renewed mission for who gets to experience them.\"\nAfter its month-long run at the new London venue, The Tempest will transfer to Broadway in October as part of the Donmar's New York season, which runs from July until February 2017.\nThe James Graham play Privacy, starring Daniel Radcliffe, and Christopher Hampton's Les Liaisons Dangereuses, will also be staged in New York.
Answer: London's Donmar Warehouse is to open a temporary theatre in King's Cross to host the company's all-female Shakespeare trilogy.

Question: The decision came after the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, Sergio Cabral, asked President Dilma Rousseff for government support ahead of the football World Cup in June.\nOn Thursday, three police bases in the city were attacked by suspected gangs.\nFour police officers have been killed since February in similar attacks.\nThe attacks on police in Brazil's second largest city have heightened concerns about law and order ahead of the World Cup, which begins on 12 June. Seven World Cup matches, including the final, will be played in Rio.\nMr Cabral discussed the violence with President Rousseff in the capital, Brasilia, after Thursday's unrest in the northern Rio favela, or shanty town, of Manguinhos.\nPolice vehicles were set on fire and the police unit's commander was shot in the leg.\nRio's authorities have been trying to rid the city's favelas of drug dealers.\n\"It is clear that criminals want to weaken our policy of pacification and take back territories which were in criminal hands for decades,\" Mr Cabral said ahead of his meeting.\n\"The state will not back down. The public may be sure we shall act,\" the governor said.\nThe authorities in Brasilia did not give say how many federal troops would be sent to Rio or when they would be deployed.\nRio police have installed more than 30 bases in favelas in the past five years to drive out drug gangs.\nCorrespondents say murders have declined and the number of shootouts has dropped, but residents have often accused the police of using heavy-handed tactics.\nThe BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio says the recent deaths among the security forces have prompted some groups to express solidarity with police and their families.\nRio de Janeiro is to host South America's first Olympic Games in 2016 as well as this year's World Cup.
Answer: The government in Brazil says it will send federal troops to Rio de Janeiro to help deal with a spate of violent attacks targeting the city's police.

Question: The deal will create the second largest cable broadband provider in the US.\nCharter had to agree to not stop its content providers from separately selling shows online, as part of the approval.\nThe deal also still needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) before it can go ahead.\nBut the head of the FCC Tom Wheeler said he was seeking approval for the deal, noting the merger conditions \"will directly benefit consumers by bringing and protecting competition to the video marketplace and increasing broadband deployment.\"\nThe DoJ said it would work with other regulators to ensure the merger did not \"choke off\" access to online videos.\n\"The settlement forbids the merged company, referred to as \"New Charter,\" from entering into or enforcing agreements that could make it more difficult for online video distributors (OVDs) to obtain video content from programmers,\" the DOJ added.\nUS cable companies are facing stiff competition from online service providers such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, as customers increasingly choose to stream films and television shows over the internet often for a lower price.\nCharter will pay $78bn (\u00c2\u00a354bn) for Time Warner and $10.8bn for Bright House.\nThe combined three firms will serve cable television and broadband to 23.9 million customers in 41 states.\nThe deal was announced last year after Comcast abandoned its $45bn plan to buy Time Warner Cable fearing pressure from regulators.
Answer: The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has approved Charter Communications purchase of cable operators Time Warner Cable and Bright House networks.

Question: Third seed Murray beat Czech eighth seed Tomas Berdych 6-4 6-4 to reach the final for a fourth time.\nThe 27-year-old Scot, who reached 500 career wins this week, won the title in 2009 and 2013.\nDefending champion Djokovic overcame USA's John Isner 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 to set up a meeting with Murray, whom he beat in Indian Wells last week.\nMurray's convincing victory, in which he broke Berdych's serve four times, took his career record against him to 6-6.\n\"I did most things well; there's not a lot I could complain about,\" said Murray.\n\"My second serve was much better in the second set. I served well on the big points and got a lot of free points behind my serve.\n\"I've played well this week, much better than I did at Indian Wells.\"\nThe match was a repeat of the Australian Open clash in January, which Murray won in four tense sets as he went up against Berdych and former coach Dani Vallverdu.\nThere was another familiar face in the Berdych box in Miami after fitness coach Jez Green recently began working with the Czech, having left Murray's team along with Vallverdu last November.\nIn contrast to Melbourne, Murray made the sharper start on Saturday, breaking the Berdych serve either side of dropping his own.\nBerdych looked unsettled, complaining about the balls and a line call as Murray saw out the set by making an impressive 77% of first serves.\nA confident Murray broke to love early in the second set, but two double faults gave the advantage straight back.\nBoth men were stepping in and attacking returns at every opportunity, and Murray's strength in that area proved the difference when he broke Berdych for a fourth time.\nHe almost clinched victory with a fifth break and had to recover from 0-30 to serve it out.\nAlthough the first set against Isner went to a tie-break, Djokovic never faced a break point as he won in an hour and a half.\n\"I played a terrific match,\" said Djokovic, who has won the Miami title four times.\n\"The opening set was pretty close. His resistance wilted a bit in the second set.\n\"Andy has been playing so well this year. He lives here and spends a lot of time practising on these courts, so he's familiar with the conditions.
Answer: Britain's Andy Murray will face world number one Novak Djokovic in the final of the Miami Open on Sunday.

Question: So far, more than 3,500 have been assessed and as a result more homes removed from the list and others added.\nHistorian John McCormack said planners must be \"flexible\" with owners with regards what warranted listing.\nLast year he labelled the planning backlog for protected or listed buildings as \"outrageous\".\nMr McCormack said: \"I'm whole heartedly behind the listing idea but that doesn't mean everything inside is worthy of listing.\n\"You've got to do it with humanity, courtesy and flexibility and you have to say to people why you want their home to be listed and get their interest going.\n\"They will be the best preservers of what is inside, they after all live there and it's their homes, and they want them to be the best as possible.\"\nIn 2012 Guernsey's Environment Department held a questionnaire asking how important it was to protect Guernsey's historic buildings.\nThe results showed a majority felt it was important but views were divided on the buildings that should qualify.
Answer: The States of Guernsey planning department has said it is making \"steady progress\" on visiting and classifying listed buildings.
